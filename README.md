# WELCOME TO THE DIGITAL LAIR OF ACHRAF EL GHAZI
Greetings, earthlings! 👽 I'm **Achraf El Ghazi**, a sophomore computer science student by day and a code-slinging ninja at **neoCedrus** by night! My keyboard has more fingerprints than a crime scene, and my GitHub has more commits than I have cups of coffee (and that's saying something).

## 📫 SUMMON ME

- 📧 Email: a.elghazi@aui.ma
- 🔮 Telepathy: Still working on this one
