## 🤔 WHO IS THIS MYSTERIOUS DEVELOPER?

Greetings, earthlings! 👽 I'm **Achraf El Ghazi**, a sophomore computer science student by day and a code-slinging ninja at **neoCedrus** by night! My keyboard has more fingerprints than a crime scene, and my GitHub has more commits than I have cups of coffee (and that's saying something).

## 💻 TECH SUPERPOWERS

```
const achraf = {
  languages: ['Typescript', 'Python', 'Java', 'C', 'idk what else'],
  currentlyLearning: '404_BRAIN_CAPACITY_FULL',
  caffeineTolerance: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER,
  debuggingStyle: 'Talk to rubber duck until solution appears',

};
```

## 📫 SUMMON ME

- 📧 Email: a.elghazi@aui.ma
- 🔮 Telepathy: Still working on this one
- 🏢 Work: That place called neoCedrus where I pretend to be professional

## 🦄 FUN FACTS

- I debug code in my sleep (not by choice)
- My commit messages range from "Fixed stuff" to "OH MY GOD IT FINALLY WORKS"
- I have a special keyboard key that types "stackoverflow.com" in one press
- I believe tabs are superior to spaces (or do I? Let's fight about it)
